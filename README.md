# Youtube UI Clone
This project is a frontend clone of the YouTube homepage, developed to master the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. It focuses on modern web layout techniques, responsive design, and replicating complex visual elements without relying on JavaScript frameworks.

## Technical Implementation
* **Semantic HTML:** Utilized semantic tags (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`) to create a structured, accessible, and SEO-friendly DOM hierarchy.
* **CSS Grid Layout:** Implemented a robust 2-dimensional grid system for the video feed. The layout automatically adjusts the number of columns based on the viewport width using media queries.
* **Flexbox Architecture:** Applied Flexbox for one-dimensional layouts, specifically within the header to manage the distribution of the menu, search bar, and user icons.
* **Advanced Positioning:** Mastered `position: fixed` to keep the header and sidebar visible during scrolling, and `position: absolute` for overlay elements like notification badges and video duration timers.

## Key Features
* **Responsive Video Grid:** A fluid layout that transitions from 2 columns on mobile devices up to 4 columns on desktop screens.
* **Fixed Navigation:** A persistent top header and left sidebar that stay anchored while the user browses the content feed.
* **Visual Fidelity:** High attention to detail in reproducing YouTube's specific spacing, typography (Roboto), and UI elements like rounded profile pictures and hover states.
* **Interactive Elements:** Custom hover effects on sidebar links and buttons to provide visual feedback to the user.
